videorent - A video rental app

Videorent is based on an interesting few pieces of QBasic, Java and 
Python code I wrote more than ten years ago to play with the 
languages. It's now reincarnated as a C/GTK+/GLib application that I 
want to develop with a layered, TDD approach. By layered I mean the 
`business' functions first, then the GUI on top of that, etc.

Videorent is very simple right now. It can't be used for anything 
serious--hacking fun only.

As such, I'm releasing it under the GNU GPL v2. See the LICENSE file 
that comes with this project or refer to
