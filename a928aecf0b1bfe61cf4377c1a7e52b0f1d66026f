Overdue-video tracking is actually fine

I just realised that I actually have set up overdue-video tracking
correctly. The determination of whether a video is overdue or not is
made by the rental object itself. The overdue count in the video object
is just for quick reference purposes. So, if we actually need to see
whether a rental is overdue or not, we are definitely getting that
accurately right now from the rental_get_overdue function.
